# H1 Introduction

This is my project for CSC 7700 Foundational AI. I'm going to make this repo private after the project has been graded, but it's public now so the graders can view it.

The Byte-Pair Encoding Tokenizer and spm training is done in the main.py file.

There are 3 AI models:
1. Recurrent Neural Network
> The python class for this model is in the file rnn_module.py. The jupyter notebook is called rnn_jupyter_notebook.ipynb
2. Long Short Term Memory
> The python class for this model is in the file lstm_model.py. The jupyter notebook is called rnn_jupyter_notebook.ipynb
3. Transformers
> The python class for this model is in the file transformer_model.py. The jupyter notebook is called transformer_jupyter_notebook.ipynb

All 3 models use the textdataset.py module to train and evaluate the models.

# H1 Train and Run Models

Each model has a corresponding jupyter notebook where you can run the model, train the model, evaluate the model, generate a response from a prompt, and look at the loss curve
All of the jupyter notebooks are at the top level of the repository
